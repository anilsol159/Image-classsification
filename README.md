# AI Pose Classifier using MoveNet

This Jupyter Notebook utilizes **MoveNet**, a state-of-the-art pose estimation model, to classify human poses based on keypoint detection. The model analyzes body movement and predicts the pose category in real-time.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses **MoveNet** (Googleâ€™s TensorFlow model) for pose estimation.
- Classifies different human poses using keypoint detection.
- Runs efficiently on CPU/GPU for real-time inference.
- Trains a classifier based on extracted pose keypoints.
- Outputs predictions with accuracy metrics.

## ðŸš€ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pose-classifier.git
   cd pose-classifier
